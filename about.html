                    <span style="color: maroon; font-weight: bolder;"> HOWDY! </span> My name is Zachary Lawton, and I am a junior Computer Science major at <a href="https://www.tamu.edu/"> Texas A&M University</a>
                    Going into college, I did not know what exactly I wanted to do with my life. I had many interests that could've led me to major in 
                    civil engineering, urban planning, history, or psychology. I finally chose computer science because it allows me to explore each of 
                    these passions to create software that can hopefully make a positive impact on people around the world.
                </p>  
                <h2> Hobbies/Interests </h2>
                <p> 
                    When I am not doing schoolwork, I keep myself occupied by participating in multiple hobbies. I enjoy working out and playing sports,
                    specifically football and basketball. My favorite football team is the <span style="color:green"> Green </span> <span style="color:gold"> Bay </span> 
                    <span style="color:green"> Packers </span> and my favorite basketball team is the <span style="color:red"> Houston Rockets. </span> When I am inside,
                    I also enjoy playing classical and modern pieces on alto saxophone, a hobby that I have had ever since middle school. I also enjoy watching movies and playing
                    video games with friends.
